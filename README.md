# Building-Cubes-Software

Building Cubes is a smart :computer: software which is highly preferred by problem setter in developing
their test files for coding problems. In addition to that, it provides other multiple applications like -

**1-** Used for building dynamic test files.

**2-** Database tables for SQL queries and test cases for coding problems can be efficiently built. 

**3-** Can be used for software and application testing. 

**4-** Can be used for the study of data structures and algorithms.


It is an open-source software and has good software quality of maintainability under which
changes can be made to satisfy new requirements or to correct deficiencies.

# Working Of Software:ledger:

The software works on the concept of Object-Oriented Programming.
It has four major phases.

**Phase 1-** User has to create an empty object.

**Phase 2-** User has to add attributes into his Object. There are two major types of attributes, Initializer, and Container.

**Phase 3-** User has to arrange positions of these attributes into his object.

**Phase 4-** User has to provide details and add values to all the attributes.


## :bulb: Once the user completes all the phases, he can build multiple test files.

## Note:memo:
This is a platform-dependent software. This is the window's version.
