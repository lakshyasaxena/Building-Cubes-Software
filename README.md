# Building-Cubes-Software

Building Cubes is a smart software which is highly preferred by problem setter in developing
their test files for coding problems. In addition to that, it provides other multiple applications like -

1-Used for building dynamic test files. 
2-Database tables for SQL queries and test cases for coding problems can be efficiently built. 
3-Can be used for software and application testing. 
4-Can be used for the study of data structures and algorithms.

It is an open-source software and has good software quality of maintainability under which
changes can be made to satisfy new requirements or to correct deficiencies.

# Working Of Software

The software works on the concept of Object-Oriented Programming.
It has four major phases.

Phase 1- User has to create an empty object.
Phase 2- User has to add attributes into his Object. There are two major types of attributes, Initializer, and Container.
Phase 3- User has to arrange positions of these attributes into his object.
Phase 4- User has to provide details and add values to all the attributes.

Once the user completes all the phases, he can build multiple test files.
